  The original idea of such tools, mainly a way to switch
  environments based on structured filesystems and defines, was
  built around 1982 in Metodo srl, Modena, Italy

  The project of "tools for projects" was branched various times,
  and in different languages too, the original idea, written in
  plain shell, is still maintained from one of the original
  authors, Lorenzo Canovi <lorenzo@kubiclabs.com>.
